I am student. Currently I am studying to be a QA.

I am going to store my studying projects in my account such as [this](https://github.com/yarocher/reqres-automation-testing-framework). In repos like this I will point that this project has learning purposes in repo "About" field. Please, remind it.

I may take mistakes, a lot of mistakes. But I want to correct them and I'm working on it. 

In each studying repo I am going to add "study.md" file or something like this to track my learning progess: there will be mistake analysis and plans to improvement. 

I hope you'll not be quite strict and check my work out.
